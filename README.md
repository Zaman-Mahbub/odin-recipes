# odin-recipes

This is the first website i'm going to make with basic html at first.
so links(<a href=""></a>), texts, images(<img src="">) elements will be used.

so made the website with two recipe html in it(one is still empty)
now allowing git to show it as a website
zaman-mahbub.github.io/odin-recipes
it's working!!
